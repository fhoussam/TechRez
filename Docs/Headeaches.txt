- setting up debugging between vscode and chrome
addchrome debugger extension
go to decoumnetation on github and get the lunch config
I had to use the configuration below to make it work, according to the documentation the key option is userDataDir !!
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch localhost",
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "url": "http://localhost:4200",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "userDataDir": true
        },
        {
            "name": "Launch index.html",
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "file": "${workspaceFolder}/index.html"
        },
    ]
}
ps : "${workspaceFolder} reperesent the currently opened folder in vscode
one last thing though, dthe following instructions might be needed, followed them, didnt have the time to verify if they're required :
in chrome.exe shortcut append this to the target, this should enabel remote debugging mode : --remote-debugging-port=9222 where 9222 is the port used to listen to your app !

	first remember that using the visual studio recommended git ignore is IMPORTANT 
	if git ignore file does not have the right configuration or does not exist

	if git ignore is good but Visual Studio wants to fuck with you, then refresh git tracking cache :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30868544/gitignore-wont-ignore-vs-folder-for-visual-studio-2015-rc-on-windows7-8
		$ git rm -r --cached .
		$ git add .
		$ git commit -m 'Update .gitignore'
