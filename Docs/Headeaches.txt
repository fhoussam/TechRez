- setting up debugging between vscode and chrome
addchrome debugger extension
go to decoumnetation on github and get the lunch config
I had to use the configuration below to make it work, according to the documentation the key option is userDataDir !!
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch localhost",
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "url": "http://localhost:4200",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "userDataDir": true
        },
        {
            "name": "Launch index.html",
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "file": "${workspaceFolder}/index.html"
        },
    ]
}
ps : "${workspaceFolder} reperesent the currently opened folder in vscode
one last thing though, dthe following instructions might be needed, followed them, didnt have the time to verify if they're required :
in chrome.exe shortcut append this to the target, this should enabel remote debugging mode : --remote-debugging-port=9222 where 9222 is the port used to listen to your app !
